        <div class="heading"><h1 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;">Lorem Ipsum<hr></h1></div>
        <div class="box1">Lorem Ipsum, sometimes referred to as ‘lipsum’, is the placeholder text used in design when creating content. It helps designers plan out where the content will sit, without needing to wait for the content to be written and approved. is among the most well-known lorem ipsum generators, if not the most well-known. It uses two hundred and fifty Latin words “mixed with a handful of model sentence structures to build lorem ipsum, which appears realistic.”</div>
        <div class="box2">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</div>
        <div class="box3">In short, we use Lorem Ipsum text because it doesn’t make sense. It’s simply filler text, so doesn’t need to hold any meaningful messaging.

            Content is intended to stand out on a page. So, if a designer or client is reviewing a template and its layout, they can easily become distracted by the writing and lose focus of the design itself.
            
            It also looks and reads more natural than just repeating a phrase like ‘content here’ or ‘example content’. Adding Lorem Ipsum placeholder text simply gives a flavour of what the final page may look like.</div>
        <div class="box4">The text can be sourced all the way back to ancient Rome. Many of the words and phrases in today’s Lorem Ipsum copy can be found in a book on ethics from 45 BC, written by the Roman philosopher, Cicero.

            However, researchers believe the text wasn’t actually used as a placeholder in its current form until the 1500s. This is when a printer took the original text and scrambled its order, to make a specimen book.
