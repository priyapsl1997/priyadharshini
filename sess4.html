        <p> Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.<br><hr><br></p>
       <p> The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants.<br><hr><br></p>
        <p>Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences.<br><hr><br></p>
