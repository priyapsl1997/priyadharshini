          The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly coloured, generally
          red, pink, yellow, or white. They often have a different coloured
          blotch at the base of the tepals, internally.The most known meaning of tulips is perfect and deep love. As tulips are a classic flower that has been loved by many for centuries they have been attached with the meaning of love.Tulip cultivation likely began in Persia (Iran) in the 10th century, and it eventually became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire. Tulips were introduced to the Western world by Augier Ghislain de Busbecq, the Viennese ambassador to Turkey, who wrote of seeing the plants in Edirne, Turkey, in 1551 and later sent some seeds to Austria. The arrival at Antwerp in 1562 of a cargo of tulip bulbs from Constantinople (now Istanbul) marked the beginning of the horticultural tulip industry in Europe. An early recipient of these flowers was French botanist Carolus Clusius, who was an avid bulb grower and is often credited with the spread of other spring bulbs, such as hyacinths and irises, across Europe.

      Tulipa (tulips) is a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, dying back after flowering to an underground storage bulb. It occurred in Holland during the early to mid-1600s, when speculation drove the value of tulip bulbs to extremes.ulips can be grown in cold, temperate, and subtropical climates. In India these bulbs can be grown at North Indian plains , Hyderabad during winters, Hills of North and south India, Valley of Kashmir(during summers), etc. Tulip cultivation likely began in Persia (Iran) in the 10th century, and it eventually became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire.
