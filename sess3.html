      Tulips are a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous
      geophytes. The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly coloured,
      generally red, pink, yellow, or white. They often have a different
      coloured blotch at the base of the tepals, internally.The most known
      meaning of tulips is perfect and deep love. As tulips are a classic flower
      that has been loved by many for centuries they have been attached with the
      meaning of love.Tulip cultivation likely began in Persia (Iran) in the
      10th century, and it eventually became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire.
      Tulips were introduced to the Western world by Augier Ghislain de Busbecq,
      the Viennese ambassador to Turkey, who wrote of seeing the plants in
      Edirne, Turkey, in 1551 and later sent some seeds to Austria. The arrival
      at Antwerp in 1562 of a cargo of tulip bulbs from Constantinople (now
      Istanbul) marked the beginning of the horticultural tulip industry in
      Europe. An early recipient of these flowers was French botanist Carolus
      Clusius, who was an avid bulb grower and is often credited with the spread
      of other spring bulbs, such as hyacinths and irises, across Europe. In the
      1590s he established a botanic garden at the University of Leiden and
      cultivated tulips there.<br>
